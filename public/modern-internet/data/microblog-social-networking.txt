        Can you articulate your thoughts in 140 characters or less? Twitter is a social media/social networking platform that allows you to promptly post short blurbs. The character limit leaves your messages right to the point, or vaguely mysterious. It's quite addicting. If you use Twitter like I do, Twitter can be like a live-stream of commentary on the happenings of your life. Big media entities, however, like CNN, use the Twitter to send quick updates about unfolding stories and breaking headlines. Websites like 9gag or Buzzfeed curate the Web and present to you bits of entertainment you could possibly like. Others, can use it to market; others, can use it to spread awareness of a good cause.
            
        Social networks have changed the way we conduct our relationships, and in effect, a big part of our lives. We are brought a little bit closer, to a point that we can go beyond borders. Novelists like Neil Gaiman, to YouTube personalities like PJ Liguori are just a tweet away. But also, we are divided by the screens we put in front of ourselves.
            
        Social networks, are just that, networks of people, personalities and entities that you decide to pull in your orbit. We can share interests and opinions, we can collaborate on projects, and we can negotiate differences.
            
        J. C. R. Licklider was right about the internet opening up computers as a communication device, but I don't know it he knew just the extent.

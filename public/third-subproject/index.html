          <p> Now that you know a bit more about the World Wide Web, maybe you were wondering about the people who made a career off it, and maybe you were even wondering if you could do the same! Many start-up businesses and passion projects have been made possible because of the internet. From the services we rely on to the applications we enjoy, there is something for everyone on the World Wide Web--the new land of opportunity.<br/>
            <br/>
            
            Whether you're the next Mark Zuckerberg or the next Tyler Oakley, the internet is a community you can cater and reach out to, to collaborate and innovate. It's an avenue to reach an audience and build a patronage. It's an entire pool of talents and resources just waiting to be harnessed.<br/>
            <br/>
            
            Crowdsourcing as a modern business model, is a means to an end that has gained popularity in 2005. Daily Crowdsourcing (dailycrowdsourcing.com) defines crowdsourcing as:
            
              <blockquote>Crowdsourcing is the process of getting work or funding, usually online, from a crowd of people. The word is a combination of the words 'crowd' and 'outsourcing'. The idea is to take work and outsource it to a crowd of workers.</blockquote>
              
            <p>For example you want to create a short film, you could send a call out for writers, actors and staff instead of approaching an agency or third party. Or if you have a big project that involves audience participation like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq7_SKjBIXohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq7_SKjBIXo">this video</a> from Jacksgap.<br/>
            
            <br/>
            
            Personally, I believe Youtube as an ideal microcosm of digital media because it's a testimony to the power of collaboration. People, just like you, creating content that you can enjoy without emptying your pocket.<br/>
              </p>

        <div class="collapsible-body white">
          <p> An example of crowdsourcing that has particularly garnered recognition, is crowdfunding--the means of acquiring funds from an online crowd. You may have heard of sites like IndieGogo, GoFundMe, Kickstarter or Patreon. Maybe, you've even supported, or have been supported on these platforms. Crowdfunding is great for this generation of content creators that are rich in ideas but a little short on the cash.<br/>
          <br/>
          
          For franchises with a large following, it is a more direct way of being funded by the fans; for upcoming talents, it is a way of reaching out to a new audience while maintaining a solid fan-following.<br/>
          <br/>
          
          You can post your project, and a call for donations. On your page, you post financial goals and a breakdown of where the money will be going. Often times, if the project is for a product, content creators will give something in return for donations, like a copy of the product plus exclusive updates as the project is underway (this is usual for sites like Patreon, Kickstarter or Indiegogo).</p>

        <div class="collapsible-body white">
          <p>With the increasing demand for content, there has emerged, various platforms to suit financial needs. It is important, however, to be wary of the hidden charges and possible pros and cons these platforms. Many reviews and blogposts can be found online, very little digging is required.<br/>
          <br/>
          
          GoFundMe supports personal fundraising. According to <a href="http://www.crowdfunding.com/">crowdfunding.org</a>, GoFundMe has raised the most money for personal causes, and from the looks of the table, one of the lowest processing fees.<br/>
          <br/>
          
          Kickstarter does not support personal fundraising and only endorses creative projects and ranked second in biggest donations<br/>
          <br/>
          
          Indiegogo<br/>
          <br/>
          
          Patreon works best for long-term projects. Pentatonix is one of the beneficiaries of this platform.<br/>
          <br/>

          Of course, there is still occasion to be wary as some sites issue hidden charges for the usage of their services.</p>

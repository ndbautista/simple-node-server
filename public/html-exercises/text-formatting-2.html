        <p>Christened <em>Nicolette Dario Bautista</em>, it was not always easy to write my own name. For a long time, I would use <strong>Nikki</strong>.0
        Nikki sounded like a strong name so for most of my life, I've used it. Only in recent years have I begun to embrace the femininity of <em>Nicolette</em>
        and the different kind of strength that implied.Born October 14, 1996 at Makati Medical Hospital to a woman who drove herself to her own labor and an artist-man
        who told stories in drawings, little Nicole was born a Libra. What does that mean? That unfortunately means that I am at most, fair;
        and on the very worst of days, <em>extremely</em> indecisive.
        <p>I was born in the Philippines, but spent much of my childhood in a the land of smiles, Thailand. I spent much of my elementary career trying to learn a
        language I still cannot speak. <strong>THAI IS HARD TO LEARN.</strong> I spent my fifth grade, and eventually graduated elementary in the Philippines in a 
        small private school. I graduated high school at <em>Great Christian Academy</em>. Growing up in a country where I didn't speak the language, or now of many
        children my age, I spent most of my time with books, creating my own stories. My favorite books are adventures. In retrospect, they might even be considered
        children's books. Peter Pan, The Book Thief and The Mysterious Benedict Society are a few of my favorite books. Max Vandenberg, a character from <em>The Book Thief</em>
        said something that still influences much of how I write:
        <blockquote>If your eyes could speak, what would they say?</blockquote></p>
        <hr>
        <p><em><pre>On a tout perdu</pre></em> is a French expression that translates to, "we lost everything." Not that I have ever lost anything in a physical fire, literal fire,
        but something similar to it. I have been familiar to loss at a very young age, but I am also very fortunate to have known of gain and redemption.</p>

        <h1>Top Picks: A Blog of my Bests and Greatest's</h1>
			<p><em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em></p>
			<p>First, but not necessarily the top spot, on my top flick picks is <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSgSe2GzDc">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a></em> (2004), directed by Michel Gondry. Recognized for his distinct surreal and whimsical cinematography, Gondry has been credited to such films as <em>Mood Indigo</em> and <em>The Science of Sleep.</em> At the very core of this emotionally charged romance are two very fragile human beings, Clementine and Joel. Their relationship is an open wound, that has been left raw and bleeding throughout their lives, even when they impulsively choose to forget each other. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the top movie picks because, while it is a heavy watch, it leaves you with a changed perspective on relationships and their aftermath.<br/>

        <br/>
			<p>Next up is <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92EBSmxinus">The Book Thief</a></em> (2013). Based on the novel of the same name, <em>The Book Thief</em> by Markus Zusak is a touching tale on-screen and on the page. Set in World War II and narrated by Death, we watch the story of young Liesl Meminger as she grows up in the care of her accordian-playing foster father and stern foster mother. She gets into the habit of stealing books. In the scheme of things, a small aspect of an even larger than life essay on the power of words in the time of Silence.<br/>

        <br/>
			<p>Lastly, we have <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgbXWt8kM5Q">Song of the Sea</a></em> (2014). An animated film from Ireland. Right off the bat, I was very excited for this film. As I discovered its trailer on Youtube, I recognized a passion of mine playing an integral part in the animation and aesthetics of the film: watercolour! Rich in native folklore and mythology, Song of the Sea is a treat to watch as well, not just for its aesthetics. Much like Pan's Labyrinth--though not as dark--its a story about stories. It's a story about a dying culture in the face of development.<br/>

			<p>You'll probably notice that these three films have a lot in common. It's probably because, at the heart of these three films, beyond all the smoke and mirrors of production, is a love for storytelling. Stories about stories.</p>

			<p><em>The Top 3 Songs of my Playlist</em></p>
			<br/>
			<p><blockquote>And at once I knew, I was not magnificent.</blockquote>
			<p>On the very top of my most played playlist, we have <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWcyIpul8OE">Holocene</a></em> by Bon Iver. To further emphasize just how much I love this song, I've actually already written a separate blog post in the past. Specifically for this song on <a href="http://of-nicolette.blogspot.com/2014/04/im-only-now-learning-what-it-all-means.html">my personal blog</a> with a list of all my favorite versions, covers and renditions. <strong>Holocene</strong>, according to Merriam-Webster is <q>of, or relating to, or being the present of post-Pleistocene geologic epoch."<br/>
			<br/>
			Generally, Bon Iver's songs are very sad. And they are. But personally, what lays <em>Holocene</em> so far from the rest is that it's a sadness about a magnificence so much greater than us. It's a sadness from seeing the beautiful, big picture and recognizing the frailty and value of our own lives. Coupled with Justin Vernon's writing sensibilities, and the musicality of Bon Iver, it was never a question of why I liked <em>Holocene</em>. I have yet to find a song that means this much to me.</p>
			<br/>
			<blockquote>The less I give, the more I get back<br/>
			Your hands can heal, your hands can bruise</blockquote>
			<p>A tough track to follow, but does the job quite well, is <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzRlcnq_c0">Poison and Wine</a></em> by the Civil Wars. I first discovered this song as a cover from Youtuber and former Glee Project contestant, Cameron Mitchell, and his then-girlfriend, Macy Maloy. Poison and Wine is another emotional track that possesses a special place in my heart. It's a song that only makes sense when though of as a duet. It's lyrics emphasize the struggle, contradiction and tension of an unhealthy relationship. What I love so much about it is that you can apply it to so much more than romantic relationships. It can be a song to yourself, about a struggle to self-love, about a struggle to commit, and so on and so forth.</p>
			<br/>
			<blockquote>Tearing down doors of time
            Shelter as we go...<br/>
            Maybe, just maybe, I'll come home.<br/>
			<em>Who am I? Who am I, darling, for you?</em></blockquote>
			<p>Lastly, is the most recent entry to my most played playlist, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI7-l1bC17M">The Promise</a></em> by Ben Howard, suggested to me by my then-favourite person in the world. It's a beautiful song to play in the background as you spend a lazy day in bed writing, reading or painting. Or maybe, just as in the music video on Ben Howard's Youtube channel, a song to listen to as you drive home--wherever that may be.</p>

			<p>I do understand that all three songs (and films) are quite heavy and sad. But if you look beyond the, sad, you'll notice that they're actually quite beautiful. I suppose you can say that the beautiful things are the saddest. But <em>anyway</em>, I hope you found something you liked, or at the very least, got to know a bit more about me.</p>

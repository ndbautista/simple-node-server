            <h3>World War 2</h3>
            <h5><em>The Sputnik Crisis and The Dawn of the Internet</em></h5>
           
            <p> Some fifty years ago, before the internet and the events leading up to it's establishment, communication and interaction was very much a linear process. Mail was sent by post from a sender to a receiver, passing through the hands of sorters and messengers--which don't differ much from the protocols inside the computer--at a much slower pace. Taking a few hours to a few weeks to send and receive messages. The internet made it possible to send data faster.</p>
            
            <p> Among others, telephone and radio were other popular means to communication at the time--this also includes military. Efforts were made, of course, to ensure that the connection was secure and any unwanted eavesdroppers could not intercept their messages.</p>
            
            <p> This was significant in the wake of World War II and the dawn of the Cold War, because, with the political and social climate of the early 1900's, a need was created for secure and private communications. And with the launch of Sputnik I in 1957 by Soviet Russia, the United States was given a jolt. The sudden success of the Soviet Sputnik program made evident a technological gap between the two super powers.</p>
            
            <p> Telephone and radio communication--which was very much still the only means of communication at the time--was made possible by huge towers that transmit radio waves to the receiving end. Electromagnetic waves that--in the presence of an electromagnetic pulse--are disrupted. In the event of a nuclear fallout, which was very much a fear following the final days of World War II in 1945, the massive electromagnetic pulse would render radio communication impossible. The military would be left blind.</p>
            
            <p> Amidst tensions rising between international superpowers, a research and development project was launched, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). For a time, DARPA focused on space and strategic missile research but later set aside these projects to focus on computing and information processing.</p>
            
            <p>This eventually led to the creation of ARPANET, a network that started out as an interconnection of four university computers but became the basis for the internet.</p>
